# Window and Fabric demo

For a small subproject on my homepage I needed a solution to display,
move and scale window-like objects around an infinite fabric element.

I took a lot of inspiration from `sshx.io` but reworked the code completely
to work with svelte5 and with less complicated features. Right now, the
system supports moving the fabric with the windows on top, moving the windows
on the fabric and scaling the fabric itself. All either with using the mouse 
and mousewheel, as well as touch-drag and pinching.

This will be integrated into the blog project, but I keep it separate as
a playground, if something does not work properly, once I add additional
functionality to the windows itself.
